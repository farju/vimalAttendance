# Universal Attendance


## About
Universal Attendance is an app that is used to perform attendance for a class electronically. The app allows a teacher to start a class role call, signaling to every student that is enrolled in the class, using email intents, that they must open their app and confirm their attendance. The app generates a 6-digit code for teachers that the students must enter in the app in order to confirm attendance; hence completing the attendance with far less hassle. The student can successfully confirm attendance by submitting the randomly generated code provided by the teacher in class within the time limit.
